HTTP1.1 was introduced in the year January 1997,it was first publisheded as RFC 2068. HTTP2 was introduced in the year May 2015 and it was published as RFC 7540.
In HTTP1.1 data can be given one by one and take much more time but HTTP2 gives parallel dataa and more information that belongs to.
HTTP2 is much faster and it can be more efficient when compare to HTTP1.1
HTTP2 solves many problems which has been created by HTTP1.1
Data Format: 
HTTP1.1 uses the plain text messages,but in HTTP2 it uses a binary format.
Server Push:
HTTP1.1 does not have the feature for severs to push,while HTTP2 allows the servers to push whatever it needs.

HTTP2 reduces header by using compression, while HTTP1.1 sends excess header information with each request add response.
Security:
HTTP2 encourage to use the server through Transport Layer Security (TLS) but HTTP1.1 does not have the secure connections.
HTTP2 is the advance method for its performance and efficiency when compare to HTTP1.1 so,HTTP2 is much better than HTTP1.1
